## Notes for Implementers

### Before Starting a New Locale
1. Read `LOCALE_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions
2. Use the template in `configs/localizations/template/`
3. Research cultural context and common scam patterns
4. Obtain appropriate ElevenLabs voice IDs

### Quality Requirements
- All 53 placeholders must be populated
- At least 3 voice IDs required
- Cultural appropriateness review needed
- Test with native speakers if possible

### Update This File
After implementing a locale:
1. Change status to ‚úÖ
2. Update placeholder count to 53/53
3. Add any implementation notes
4. Record completion date in notes
