# Quality Improvements Implementation Summary

**Date**: October 22, 2025  
**Version**: Implementation Complete  
**Status**: ✅ Ready for Testing

---

## Overview

This document summarizes the qualitative improvements made to the Malaysian conversation generation pipeline to address:
1. Unnatural Malay speech patterns identified in native speaker review
2. Scam type coverage alignment with LG specifications

---

## 1. Natural Speech Pattern Improvements

### Problem Statement

The annotated LG feedback document highlighted conversations with:
- **Overused particles** breaking grammatical meaning
- **Awkward word choices** signaling AI generation
- **Broken grammar** instead of natural imperfections
- **Overly colloquial speech** that overshoots natural casualness

### Specific Issues Fixed

From the annotated PDF, we addressed phrases like:
- ❌ "mengaku pasti" → ✅ "pastikan" or "untuk pastikan"
- ❌ "membangun kepercayaan" → ✅ "menguatkan kepercayaan"
- ❌ "kemas kini terakhir" → ✅ "kemas kini buat kali terakhir"
- ❌ "langkah yang pertama" → ✅ "langkah pertama"
- ❌ Excessive particle use every sentence → ✅ Strategic 1-2 per turn

### Implementation Changes

#### Files Modified:
1. **`src/conversation/legit_generator.py`**
2. **`src/conversation/scam_generator.py`**

#### Key Enhancements:

**A. Added "Balance Natural vs Formal" Framework**
```
**CRITICAL: Balance Natural vs Formal**
- Natural speech has minor imperfections, NOT broken grammar
- Particles enhance meaning; they don't replace proper grammar
- Maintain grammatical foundation while adding conversational elements
- Test: Would a native Malaysian speaker actually say this phrase?
```

**B. Refined Particle Usage Guidelines**
- **Before**: "Use frequently for realism"
- **After**: "Use strategically, NOT excessively" with quantitative guidance (1-2 per turn)
- Added warnings against overuse that breaks meaning
- Emphasized end-of-phrase placement

**C. Balanced Filler/Disfluency Usage**
- **Before**: "Use frequently"
- **After**: "Use moderately" (1-3 per turn, not every sentence)
- Distinguished between professional speakers (fewer) and casual speakers (more)

**D. Enhanced Formality Matching**
- Added speaker-specific formality guidelines:
  - **Professional scammers**: Clearer grammar for credibility
  - **Government/bank staff**: Formal-professional hybrid
  - **Service industry**: Casual-friendly with strategic particles
  - **Elderly victims**: More traditional, fuller sentences
  - **Young urban speakers**: More casual with code-switching

**E. Added "Common Pitfalls to AVOID" Section**
```
**Common Pitfalls to AVOID:**
- Overusing particles until sentences lose meaning
- Using formal words incorrectly: "mengaku" when you mean "pastikan"
- Breaking grammar to force casualness
- Awkward constructions: "membangun kepercayaan" → "menguatkan kepercayaan"
- Adding unnecessary words: "langkah yang pertama" → "langkah pertama"
- Mixing formality inconsistently within same character
- Making professional scammers sound too casual (breaks credibility)
```

**F. Strengthened "Grammatical Foundation" Guidance**
```
**Grammatical Foundation (Real speech has minor imperfections, not errors):**
- Natural imperfections: Minor word order shifts, dropped optional words
- DON'T create broken grammar that confuses meaning
- DON'T force imperfections that native speakers wouldn't make
- Scammers: Generally clearer grammar to maintain credibility
```

**G. Enhanced Natural Speech Realism Section**
Added distinction between natural and unnatural imperfections:
```
**Human Imperfections vs Errors:**
- Natural: "Saya ni, saya nak tanya..." (double subject, natural Malay)
- Natural: "Awak tahu tak?" (simplified question form)
- Unnatural: Breaking sentences mid-thought without context
- Unnatural: Using words incorrectly or forcing grammatical errors
- Unnatural: Making authority figures sound too casual or broken
```

**H. Scammer-Specific Speech Patterns**
Added detailed scammer speech style guide:
```
- Professional/Authority Scammers: Clearer grammar, strategic particles (1-2 max)
- Casual/Sympathetic Scammers: Moderate particles, emotional tone
- Tech-Savvy Scammers: Technical terms + casual explanations
- Key: Maintain grammatical foundation - scammers don't use broken Malay
```

## 2. Scam Coverage Analysis

### LG Requirements vs Current Coverage

Created comprehensive analysis document: `SCAM_COVERAGE_ANALYSIS.md`

**Summary**:

| Category | Target % | Current % | Status |
|----------|----------|-----------|--------|
| Macau Scam | 33.2% | 26.3% | ✅ Close |
| E-commerce Fraud | 30.0% | 15.8% | ⚠️ Gap |
| Investment Fraud | 15.6% | 10.5% | ⚠️ Small Gap |
| Loan Fraud | 12.3% | 10.5% | ✅ Close |

**Key Findings**:
- **Well-covered**: Macau Scam (government authority), Loan Fraud
- **Gaps identified**: Voice scam (AI cloning), SMS phishing, social media giveaway
- **Pipeline**: Functionally sound, needs seed inventory expansion
- **Recommendation**: Create 6-8 new seeds for E-commerce subcategories

## 3. Testing and Validation

### Validation Checklist

Before deploying to production, test conversations should be reviewed for:

- [ ] **Particles used naturally** (not excessively, 1-2 per turn)
- [ ] **Grammar maintains meaning** (imperfections are subtle)
- [ ] **Word choices sound natural** for context and speaker
- [ ] **Formality matches speaker type** (professional vs casual)
- [ ] **No phrases from "avoid" list** appear
- [ ] **Professional scammers** use clearer grammar
- [ ] **Victims** show appropriate confusion/skepticism
- [ ] **Code-switching** is contextually appropriate
- [ ] **Fillers used moderately** (1-3 per turn, not every sentence)
- [ ] **Overall conversation** sounds like native Malaysian speech

### Test Generation Command

```bash
# Generate test batch (50 conversations)
python main.py --locale ms-my --scam --seed-limit 10 --scenarios-per-seed 5 --verbose

# Output location
# output/ms-my/{timestamp}/conversations/scam_conversations.json
```

### Comparison Methodology

1. **Before/After Comparison**: Compare new conversations with `scam_labeling/` samples
2. **Native Speaker Review**: Critical for final validation
3. **Pattern Check**: Verify no repeated unnatural patterns from annotated feedback
4. **Formality Audit**: Ensure scammers maintain appropriate authority/credibility
